# Machine Learning Projects by Basant Ahmed Ragab Mohamed

## Overview
This repository contains 4 hands-on machine learning projects that demonstrate data analysis, predictive modeling, and business-oriented solutions:

1. **Student Score Prediction**  
   Predicting student exam scores based on study hours and other relevant features using regression models.

2. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Clustering customers based on behavior to help businesses target marketing strategies effectively.

3. **Loan Approval Prediction**  
   Predicting loan approval decisions for applicants using historical data and classification algorithms.

4. **Walmart Sales Forecasting**  
   Forecasting weekly sales for Walmart stores using historical sales data and time-series modeling techniques.

## Motivation
These projects were completed as part of my Machine Learning training with Elevvo Pathways. They helped me gain practical experience in the full machine learning workflow:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training, evaluation, and optimization  
- Visualization and interpretation of results
